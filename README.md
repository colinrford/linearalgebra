# linearalgebra

The goal behind this repository is to create from the ground up a robust, powerful linear algebra C++ library - it is a test of my understanding of linear algebra and the C++ language. My vision for this is different than that of, e.g., Matlab's; I want to eventually introduce this as both a tool for professional mathematicians as well as a learning source for the young mathematician. I realize that there are existing libraries or softwares out there that share (some of) this vision, however, I hope to provide perhaps a more intuitive interface that reduces the time involved with various computations.

It is a very, very slow process, but I hope that 2016 proves to be a productive year for this thing.
