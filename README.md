# linearalgebra

just another math library..

Built with unique\_ptr, compile with c++20. Currently only 'trivial' 
classes and methods (and all that) are implemented. Will report back with 
performance later. 

It's a work-in-progress, probably a bit wasteful of memory resources in its 
current iteration.
